\section sec_intro Introduction

<b>Ork</b> is a small <b>O</b>penGL <b>r</b>endering <b>k</b>ernel.
It must not be confused with the Ogre library: although Orks and
Ogres have some common characteristics, Orks are usually smaller :-).
The Ork library provides core functionalities related to 3D
rendering: mathematical classes for vector and matrices, an 
object-oriented view of the OpenGL API, a framework to load rendering
resources such as meshes, textures or shaders from disk. It also
provides a minimal and generic "toy" scene graph to describe 3D 
scenes, based on a task scheduling framework.

\section sec_core Core classes

The core classes of Ork are provided in the \ref core and \ref math
modules. The first module provides memory management facilities
(namely a smart pointer framework), as well as some utility classes
to log messages, measure time or iterate over STL collections. The
second module provides classes related to linear algebra in 2D and
3D (vectors and matrices).

\subsection sec_object Smart pointers

The main class in \ref core is the ork::Object class, and the
related ork::ptr and ork::static_ptr templates. These
classes provide a smart pointer framework i.e., a framework that
ensures the automatic destruction of objects when they are no longer
referenced. 

\note with the USE_SHARED_PTR preprocessor flag ork::ptr extends 
std::tr1::shared_ptr; without this flag ork::ptr is fully implemented in Ork
(using an intrusive counter in ork::Object). Note that, with the 
USE_SHARED_PTR flag, you can use either ork::ptr or std::tr1::shared_ptr
in your application: since ork::ptr is a subclass of std::tr1::shared_ptr,
the result of an Ork function returning a ork::ptr can be stored 
transparently in a std:tr1::shared_ptr. Conversely, you can transparently
pass a std::tr1::shared_ptr to an Ork function requiring a ork::ptr, 
because there is an implicit ork::ptr constructor taking a 
std::tr1::shared_ptr as argument.

All the classes that inherit from ork::Object have
this automatic destruction behavior. All the instances of theses
classes have a reference counter, declared in ork::Object,
which is incremented (resp. decremented) each time a new
ork::ptr or ork::static_ptr reference to an object is
created (resp. deleted). For instance, in the following code

\code
void f() {
    ptr<Object> o = new Object(); // shortcut for ptr<Object>(new Object());
    // ...
}
\endcode

an object is created in heap memory with the new operator, and its
reference counter is incremented during the creation of the <tt>
ptr<Object></tt> reference. At the end of the function the destructor
of this reference is automatically called (as defined in the C++
specification), which decrements the reference counter of the object.
And if this counter becomes null, then the object destructor is
called.

Notes:
<ul>
<li>thanks to C++ implicit conversion rules, you can use smart
pointers almost like normal pointers. In particular you can write, as
above, <tt>ptr<Object> o = new Object();</tt> instead of using an
explicit constructor call <tt>ptr<Object> o = ptr<Object>(new
Object());</tt>. Also the ork::ptr class defines the =, ==, !=,
* and -> operators, so that you can assign, compare and dereference
smart pointers like ordinary pointers. Finally you can cast a smart
pointer to another smart pointer type <tt>ptr<T></tt> with <tt>
o.cast<T>()</tt> (note that if <tt>D</tt> is a subclass of <tt>
C</tt>, a <tt>ptr<D></tt> can be used anywhere a <tt>ptr<C></tt> is
expected, without any cast).</li>

<li>the ork::static_ptr template is similar to ork::ptr,
but is reserved for static variables. By calling
ork::Object#exit at the end of your program, you can then set
all these static references to <tt>NULL</tt>, which should destroys
all statically referenced objects. Note that, in debug compilation
mode, the <tt>exit</tt> method checks that all ork::Object
instances have been destroyed, which is useful to detect memory
leaks. One way to ensure that this method is called at the end of
your program is to use <tt>atexit(Object::exit);</tt>.</li>

<li>you can change the default behavior that destroys an object when
its reference count becomes 0 by overriding the
ork::Object#doRelease method.</li>
</ul>

Restrictions:
<ul>
<li>do not mix smart pointers and normal pointers to the same object
(or be very careful if you do that). Otherwise the reference counter
is not accurate and an object may be destroyed while it is still
referenced via normal pointers. For instance, in the following code
\code
void f(ptr<Object> o);

void g() {
    Object *o = new Object();
    f(o); // shortcut for f(ptr<Object>(o));
    delete o; // Error: double delete!
}
\endcode
a smart pointer to <tt>o</tt> is implicitly created when it is
passed to <tt>f</tt>, since this function takes a smart pointer as
parameter. This increments the reference counter of <tt>o</tt> to 1
(and not 2 because the first reference is via a normal pointer). But
this smart pointer is also implicitly destroyed after the call,
which decrements this counter to 0, and hence deletes <tt>o</tt>
automatically. The explicit delete then leads to an error, since the
object was already deleted.</li>

<li>do not create cycles of smart pointers. Indeed if a cycle of
objects referencing each other is no longer referenced, each object
in the cycle is still referenced by another object of this cycle.
Hence the whole cycle can not be deleted, which leads to memory
leaks. One way to avoid cycles of smart pointers is to use normal
pointers somewhere in the cycle (this must be done with care - see
above). A common pattern is the following:
\code
class C
{
public:
    ptr<D> d;
    ~C() {
        d->c = NULL; // deletes normal pointers to this
    }
};

class D
{
public:
    C* c; // using ptr<C> would create smart pointer cycles!
};
\endcode
since the reference <tt>c</tt> in <tt>D</tt> is a normal pointer, and
since objects of class <tt>C</tt> are managed everywhere else via
smart pointers, the object referenced by <tt>c</tt> in <tt>D</tt> can
be deleted at any moment. To avoid an access to a deleted object via
this reference, <tt>C</tt> erases the normal pointers to itself in
its destructor. We call <tt>c</tt> a <i>weak pointer</i>, since the
referenced object can be deleted at any moment (on the contrary, a
smart pointer can be called a <i>strong pointer</i>, because the
referenced object can not be deleted while this reference is not set
to <tt>NULL</tt>).</li>
</ul>

\subsection sec_logger Message logs

The Ork logging framework can be used to log messages. A message can
be an error message, a warning message, an informative message, or a
debug message. It has a topic and a content. The main class is the
ork::Logger class. This class stores in static variables
several loggers for error, warning, informative and debug messages,
one per category. It also defines a ork::Logger#log method, to
log a message in a given topic. A typical use is the following:

\code
if (Logger::INFO_LOGGER != NULL) {
    Logger::INFO_LOGGER->log("my topic", "my message");
}
\endcode

The ork::Logger class prints messages to the standard output.
The ork::FileLogger subclass writes messages to an HTML file.
The ork::FileLogger can be chained to another logger. It is
then possible to log messages both to standard output and to an HTML
file. You can also define your own logger subclass. All loggers can
be configured to print only the messages related to one or more
topics, with the ork::Logger#addTopic method (by default they
print all messages, whatever their topic). The topics defined in the
Ork library are the following:
<ul>
<li>CORE messages about smart pointers</li>
<li>OPENGL messages about OpenGL</li>
<li>LINKER messages about OpenGL shader linker</li>
<li>COMPILER messages about OpenGL shader compiler</li>
<li>RESOURCE messages about resources</li>
<li>SCENEGRAPH messages about the scene graph</li>
<li>SCHEDULER messages about the task scheduler</li>
</ul>

\subsection sec_ork_math Maths

The \ref math module provides classes related to linear algebra in
2D and 3D (vectors and matrices).

<ul>
<li>The templates ork::math::vec2, ork::math::vec3, ork::math::vec4, 
ork::math::mat2, ork::math::mat3
and ork::math::mat4 represent 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and matrices. They
provide all usual operations, such as the addition and subtraction of
vectors or matrices, matrix vector and matrix matrix multiplication,
matrix inversion, matrix transposition, vector normalization, vector
dot product and cross product, etc. They can be instanced with <tt>float</tt>,
<tt>double</tt> or even <tt>int</tt> types. Several
instantiations are predefined: ork::math::vec3f, ork::math::vec3d,
ork::math::mat3f, ork::math::mat3d, etc.</li>

<li>The templates ork::math::box2 and ork::math::box3 represent 2D and 3D
bounding boxes. They provide functions to enlarge a bounding box, and
to test if bounding box contains a point or another bounding box, or intersects
another bounding box.</li>
</ul>

\section sec_render Rendering framework

The \ref render module provides the Ork
rendering framework, an object oriented view of the OpenGL API. 
The OpenGL API can be quite unnatural and hard to use for C++ programmers. 
The first reason is that OpenGL "objects" are simply represented with 
identifiers, instead of instances of classes. The second and probably most
important reason is that these "objects" must be bound to a "target" before
being usable. Indeed, these idioms are not compatible with the basic 
principles of object-oriented languages.
Ork solves theses problems by providing a minimal object-oriented
API on top of OpenGL. This means three things:
<ul>
<li>first, that Ork is based on OpenGL 3.3 core profile (with partial support
for 4.0 and 4.1). The compatibility profile is excluded by design, to keep
a minimal API.</li>
<li>second, that OpenGL framebuffers, programs, shaders, uniforms, textures, 
samplers, buffers, queries, etc are represented with concrete C++ classes.</li>
<li>third, and most importantly, that these classes encapsulate the dirty 
OpenGL implementation details. In particular they hide object identifiers, 
as well as the need to bind an object before being able to use it.</li>
</ul>

This brings many benefits for programmers, as shown by the following example.
Suppose that you want to draw a mesh in an offscreen framebuffer, with a 
program that uses a texture. Assuming that  these objects are already 
created, with the OpenGL API you need to:
- set the program as the current program: <tt>glUseProgram(myProgram);</tt>
- choose a texture unit and set it as the current one: <tt>glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + myUnit);</tt>
- bind the texture to this unit: <tt>glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, myTexture);</tt>
- bind the texture unit to the program: <tt>glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation(myProgram, "mySampler"), myUnit);</tt>
- set the mesh VBO as the current VBO: <tt>glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, myVBO);</tt>
- specify the format of the vertices in the VBO, e.g. <tt>glVertexAttribPointer(0, 4, GL_FLOAT, false, 16, 0);</tt>
- enable the vertex attributes in the VBO, e.g. <tt>glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);</tt>
- set the framebuffer as the current one: <tt>glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, myFramebuffer);</tt>
- and, finally (!), draw the VBO, e.g. <tt>glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);</tt>

With the Ork API you simply need two steps (and the first one does not need
to be repeated before each draw, unless you want a different texture for 
each draw):
- set the value of the program uniform: <tt>myProgram->getUniformSampler("mySampler")->set(myTexture);</tt>
- draw the mesh with the program in the framebuffer: <tt>myFramebuffer->draw(myProgram, *myMesh);</tt>

Under the hood, Ork will automatically select a texture unit, bind the 
texture to this unit, bind this unit to the program, set the program
as the current one, set the mesh VBO as the current one, set the 
framebuffer as the current one, etc. Moreover, Ork automatically 
minimizes the OpenGL state changes used to implement this API (without
reordering the API calls: i.e., Ork will not reorder the sequence 
<tt>myFBO->draw(myProgram1, *myVBO); myFBO->draw(myProgram2, *myVBO); 
myFBO->draw(myProgram1, *myVBO); myFBO->draw(myProgram2, *myVBO);</tt> to
minimize the number of <tt>glUseProgram</tt> calls; however, for the 
sequence <tt>myFBO->draw(myProgram1, *myVBO); myFBO->draw(myProgram1, 
*myVBO); myFBO->draw(myProgram2, *myVBO); myFBO->draw(myProgram2, *myVBO);</tt>,
Ork will only use two <tt>glUseProgram</tt> calls, not four).

The Ork rendering framework is organized around a few
concepts: <i>framebuffers</i> configured via parameters
(for the few remaining fixed parts of the pipeline), are used 
to draw <i>meshes</i> into one or more <i>render
targets</i> (which can be <i>textures</i>) using a set of <i>
modules</i> linked into <i>programs</i>. The meshes define a set of
user defined <i>attributes</i> per vertex (there are no predefined
attributes such as normals or colors), which are processed by the
programs, configured via <i>uniform variables</i>.

The rendering framework defines classes for all these elements. These
classes extend the ork::Object class, so that GPU resources are
automatically deleted when they are no longer used (for example when
a ork::Texture object is no longer referenced it is deleted,
which deletes the corresponding OpenGL texture in GPU memory).

The rendering API fully covers the OpenGL 3.3 core profile, and 
partially covers the OpenGL 4.0 and 4.1 core profile APIs (tesselation
shaders are supported, but uniform subroutines, binary shaders and 
programs, pipeline objects, separable shaders, and multiple viewports
are currently not supported).

\subsection sec_meshes Meshes

A mesh is a list of vertices organized in some topology (points,
lines, line strip, triangles, triangle strip, etc). Each vertex has
some attributes. Attributes are user defined and can hold any kind of
value (position, normal, color, texture coordinates, etc). The
attributes are grouped into ork::AttributeBuffer, grouped
themselves into an ork::MeshBuffers. An attribute buffer
describes the storage format for one vertex attribute. The values of
this attribute for all the vertices of the mesh are not stored in the
attribute buffer itself, but in a separate ork::Buffer. This
buffer can reside in CPU memory if an ork::CPUBuffer is used,
or in GPU memory if an ork::GPUBuffer is used.

Thanks to the \link ork::AttributeBuffer#getStride stride
\endlink and \link ork::AttributeBuffer#getOffset offset
\endlink parameters in ork::AttributeBuffer, the attributes
of the vertices of a mesh can be organized in many different ways.
Here are some possibilities:
<ul>
<li>use one buffer per attribute type. For instance use one buffer to
store the positions of the vertices, another to store their colors,
another to store their texture coordinates, etc. In this case some
buffers can be on CPU, while the others are on GPU.</li>

<li>use one buffer to store all the attributes. In this case the
attributes can be interleaved or not in this buffer:

  <ul>
  <li>in the non interleaved mode, the buffer starts with all the
  values of the first attribute, continues with all the values of the
  second attribute, and so on. Such a buffer would contain all the
  positions, then all the colors, the all the texture coordinates,
  and so on.</li>

  <li>in the interleaved mode, the buffer stores all the attributes
  of the first vertex, then all the attributes of the second vertex,
  and so for all vertices. Such a buffer would contain the position,
  color and texture coordinate of the first vertex, the position,
  color and texture coordinate of the second vertex, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

This flexibility can be an advantage to organize your mesh data as
you want, but it complicates the creation of a mesh. In order to
simplify the creation of meshes using the interleaved storage mode in
a single buffer, it is possible to use the ork::Mesh
template. For example, the following code

\code
ptr< Mesh<vec4f, unsigned byte> > m;
m = new Mesh<vec4f, unsigned byte>(TRIANGLE_STRIP, GPU_STATIC);
m->addAttributeType(0, 2, A32F, false);
m->addAttributeType(1, 2, A32F, false);
m->addVertex(vec4f(-1, -1, 0, 0));
m->addVertex(vec4f(1, -1, 1, 0));
m->addVertex(vec4f(-1, 1, 0, 1));
m->addVertex(vec4f(1, 1, 1, 1));
\endcode

creates a mesh with the triangle strip topology, where each vertex is
represented with a vec4f struct (you can use any user defined
structure to describe the vertices). Each vertex has two attributes,
described with ork::Mesh#addAttributeType. The first one is
made of two floats, as well as the second one (they can be
interpreted as a 2D position and a 2D texture coordinate). The
vertices are defined with ork::Mesh#addVertex, using the type
passed as template parameter for the mesh. The resulting
ork::MeshBuffers can then be retrieved with
ork::Mesh#getBuffers.

\subsubsection sec_meshes1 Attribute identifiers

Each vertex attribute has an identifier represented with an integer
(specified by the first argument of the ork::AttributeBuffer
constructor, or of the \link ork::Mesh#addAttributeType 
addAttributeType\endlink method. You must specifiy these identifiers
in your shaders, with a <tt>location</tt> layout qualifier. For
instance, using <tt>layout(location=0) in vec3 position;</tt>

\subsubsection sec_meshes2 Indexed meshes

A mesh with the triangles topology must be defined by giving the 3
vertices of a first triangle, followed by the 3 vertices of a second
triangle, and so on for all triangles. This can lead to a waste of
space, since a vertex shared between several triangles must be
duplicated several times (the same problem occurs with other
topologies as well). A way to limit this duplication is to use a
triangle strip topology, but this is not always convenient. Another
way is to use an <i>indexed</i> mesh. In this case the vertices are
described once in an array, then the vertices that make up each
triangle are described by their index in this array.

This kind of mesh can be defined in ork by using
ork::MeshBuffers#setIndicesBuffer. This method takes an
ork::AttributeBuffer as parameter, that describes the indices
of the mesh vertices in the other attribute buffers, seen as vertex
arrays. This can also be done with a ork::Mesh, using the
ork::Mesh::addIndice method (the format of the vertex indices
is then specified by the second parameter of the ork::Mesh
template).

\subsubsection sec_meshes3 Modifying meshes

A mesh can be modified by modifying the ork::Buffer that
contain the actual vertex data. In the case of a
ork::CPUBuffer you can directly modify the buffer content in
CPU memory. In the case of a ork::GPUBuffer, you can either
use the ork::GPUBuffer#setData or
ork::GPUBuffer#setSubData methods, or you can map the buffer
content to CPU memory with ork::GPUBuffer#map, and then
modify this mapped buffer directly in CPU memory, before unmapping
it.

\subsubsection sec_meshes4 Drawing meshes

A mesh must be drawn with the ork::FrameBuffer#draw method,
either with a ork::MeshBuffers argument, or with a
ork::Mesh argument. In the first case you can specify a
different mesh topology and vertex count than in the
ork::MeshBuffers itself (this could be used to draw only a
part of the mesh). In both cases you can specify the number of times
this mesh must be drawn (this is called geometry instancing).

\subsection sec_shaders Modules

A mesh must be drawn by using a set of shaders linked into a <i>program</i>.
The shaders use the vertex attributes to compute the projected
positions of vertices in the render targets, and the color or other
data to write in these render targets. They can also use some uniform
variables, whose value is constant during the rendering of a mesh.

In Ork a ork::Program is made of one or more ork::Module
linked together. Each ork::Module object groups in the same object 
a (part of a) vertex shader, a (part of a) tessellation control shader,
a (part of a) tessellation evaluation shader, a (part of
a) geometry shader and a (part of a) fragment shader (all parts are
optional). All parts are optional.  These parts must be defined either 
each in its own file:

\verbatim
 ... vertex shader GLSL code ...
\endverbatim
<center><b>myModuleVS.glsl</b></center>
\verbatim
 ... tessellation control shader GLSL code ...
\endverbatim
<center><b>myModuleTCS.glsl</b></center>
\verbatim
 ... tessellation evaluation shader GLSL code ...
\endverbatim
<center><b>myModuleTES.glsl</b></center>
\verbatim
 ... geometry shader GLSL code ...
\endverbatim
<center><b>myModuleGS.glsl</b></center>
\verbatim
 ... fragment shader GLSL code ...
\endverbatim
<center><b>myModuleFS.glsl</b></center>

or all grouped in a single file, but separated with the following
preprocessor directives (this option can reduce the redundancy 
between shaders, which often use the same uniform variables and
user defined data types and functions):

\verbatim
 ... common GLSL code ...

#ifdef _VERTEX_
 ... vertex shader GLSL code ...
#endif

#ifdef _TESS_CONTROL_
 ... tessellation control shader code ...
#endif

#ifdef _TESS_EVAL_
 ... tessellation evaluation shader code ...
#endif

#ifdef _GEOMETRY_
 ... geometry shader GLSL code ...
#endif

#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
 ... fragment shader GLSL code ...
#endif
\endverbatim
<center><b>A module whose shaders are in a single file myModule.glsl</b></center>

where each <tt>ifdef</tt> section is optional (the code is included
in all vertex, tessellation, geometry and fragment OpenGL shaders, unless it is
inside an <tt>ifdef</tt> section. In this case it is included only in
the corresponding OpenGL shader). The common code can include uniform
variables and data type declarations that are common to the vertex,
tessellation, geometry and fragment parts.

A ork::Program is made of one or more ork::Module
linked together. Using several ork::Module to create a
program can be useful to define modular code, where one module
uses a function implemented in another module. For example, you can
use something like this in a "wood" ork::Module

\verbatim
... common GLSL code ...

#ifdef _VERTEX_
 ... vertex shader GLSL code ...
#endif

#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
layout(location=0) out vec4 color;

// function prototype, no implementation
vec3 illuminate(vec3 p);

void main() {
   vec3 p = ... // position
   vec3 light = illuminate(p);
   color = ... // compute reflected light
}
#endif
\endverbatim

using an abstract <tt>illuminate</tt> function to compute the
incident light at p, and a "point light" module to define how this
incident light is computed:

\verbatim
uniform vec3 lightPos;
uniform vec3 lightColor;

vec3 illuminate(vec3 p) {
    vec3 v = p - lightPos;
    return lightColor / dot(v, v);
}

#ifdef _VERTEX_
#endif

#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
#endif
\endverbatim

One advantage it that you can then define another version of this
<tt>illuminate</tt> function, for instance for a spot light, that you
can combine with the "wood" module without needing to rewrite it.
Note that we defined the <tt>illuminate</tt> function in the common section so 
that we can use this function in a vertex shader for per-vertex
lighting, or in a fragment shader of per pixel lighting. Another
advantage is that you can combine these "point light" and "spot
light" modules with other "material" modules, for instance with a
"marble" module (this means that a ork::Module can be used by
several ork::Program). Hence can you avoid code duplication
between all these material shaders.

\subsubsection sec_shaders1 Uniforms

The uniform variables of a program are represented with the
ork::Uniform class and its subclasses. Uniforms can 
be retrieved with the ork::Program#getUniform and 
<tt>getUniformXxx</tt> methods. Uniforms inside uniform blocks
can be retrieved in the same way, or in two steps via 
ork::Program#getUniformBlock and 
ork::UniformBlock#getUniform.

As in OpenGL, the value of a ork::Uniform is 
"persistent", which means that this value remains the same
forever, unless you change it with ork::Uniform#setValue
(or one of the specific <tt>set</tt> methods in the
ork::Uniform subclasses).

The value of a uniform defined in an uniform block is set like
the value of an uniform in the default block. Under the hood, Ork
automatically creates a ork::GPUBuffer object for the
uniform block, and maps and unmaps it in main memory when 
necessary.

<b>Important note:</b> For the best performance you should not
use ork::Program#getUniform in your rendering loop.
Instead of doing this:
\verbatim
... initialization
for (each frame) {
    ...
    myProgram->getUniform1f("x")->set(...);
    myFrameBuffer->draw(myProgram, *myMesh);
    ...
}
\endverbatim
Use this:
\verbatim
... initialization
ptr<Uniform1f> x = myProgram->getUniform1f("x");
for (each frame) {
    ...
    x->set(...);
    myFrameBuffer->draw(myProgram, *myMesh);
    ...
}
\endverbatim


\subsection sec_textures Textures

The OpenGL textures are represented in Ork with the
ork::Texture class and its subclasses. Each texture
has an <i>internal format</i> describing the number of components (or
color channels) per pixel and the number of bits per components. Each
texture also has a set of parameters, represented with the
ork::Texture::Parameters class.
In Ork the texture parameters are immutable, i.e., only the
content of the texture can be changed at runtime. 

The texture
parameters are specified in the texture constructor. An initial
texture content can also be specified in the constructor, using a
ork::Buffer object. Using a \link ork::CPUBuffer
CPUBuffer(NULL)\endlink can be used to left this content
uninitialized. Using a ork::GPUBuffer can be used to
initialize the texture content from a buffer already on GPU (the
content of this buffer is <i>copied</i> to the texture, it is not use
as is, by reference). The texture content can be read back on CPU
with the ork::Texture#getImage method.

The texture content can be changed at runtime in two ways. The first
one copies the new content from a buffer object, the second one from
a framebuffer attachment:
<ul>

<li>the \link ork::Texture2D#setSubImage setSubImage\endlink
methods specify which sub part of the texture must be changed, the
new values being provided in a ork::CPUBuffer or
ork::GPUBuffer.</li>

<li>the \link ork::FrameBuffer#copyPixels copyPixels\endlink
methods copy a part of a framebuffer attachment (specified with
ork::FrameBuffer#setReadBuffer) into a sub part of a
texture.</li>
</ul>

\subsubsection sec_textures1 Compressed textures

Ork supports compressed textures, i.e., textures whose content on
GPU is compressed. There are special methods to
read and write the content of these textures:
<ul>
<li>the initial content is specified in the texture constructor, as
for uncompressed textures, but you need to provide the compressed
texture size in the buffer parameters, represented with the 
ork::Buffer::Parameters class.</li>

<li>the texture content must be read back on CPU with the
ork::Texture::getCompressedImage method. The compressed
texture size can be retrieved with
ork::Texture::getCompressedSize.</li>

<li>the texture content must be changed at runtime with the \link
ork::Texture2D#setCompressedSubImage
setCompressedSubImage\endlink methods.</li>
</ul>

\subsubsection sec_textures2 Uniform samplers

A texture can be bound to a uniform sampler in a program very simply,
with a ork::UniformSampler object. For instance, if <tt>
p</tt> is a ork::Program made of the following module

\verbatim
uniform samplerCube envMap;
...
void main() {
   ...
   vec4 c = texture(envMap, d);
   ...
}
\endverbatim

then you can bind a texture to its <tt>envMap</tt> uniform sampler
like this:

\code
ptr<TextureCube> t = ...
p->getUniformSampler("envMap")->set(t);
\endcode

\subsection sec_framebuffers Framebuffers

The ork::FrameBuffer class is used to represent both the
default framebuffer and the OpenGL framebuffer objects.
As in OpenGL, a framebuffer has some attachments. These attachments
are associated with their framebuffer, i.e., when a framebuffer
is used to draw a mesh, the textures and render buffers attached to this
framebuffer become the new current render targets automatically. In Ork
this idea has been extended to the pipeline state (viewport, stencil and
depth tests, clearing, culling, blending and writing states, etc). 
This means that each framebuffer has its own associated
pipeline state. When a framebuffer is used to draw a mesh, its associated
pipeline state is automatically set up to replace the pipeline state
of the previous framebuffer.

The framebuffer attachments are defined with the
ork::FrameBuffer#setRenderBuffer and ork::FrameBuffer#setTextureBuffer
methods.

The framebuffer pipeline state is represented with
the ork::FrameBuffer::Parameters class and can be modified
with the getter and setter methods of the ork::FrameBuffer
class.

The default framebuffer is accessible via the
ork::FrameBuffer#getDefault static method (the attachments of
this framebuffer cannot be changed, but its pipeline
state <i>can</i> be changed). The user defined framebuffers are
created with the ork::FrameBuffer constructor.

The main methods of ork::FrameBuffer are the \link
ork::FrameBuffer#draw draw\endlink methods to draw meshes
(there is also a convenient \link ork::FrameBuffer#drawQuad
drawQuad\endlink method to draw quads). There are also some methods
to \link ork::FrameBuffer#clear clear\endlink the render
targets, and to read and copy pixels from these attachments:

<ul>
<li>the ork::FrameBuffer#readPixels method can be used to
copy pixels from one of the framebuffer attachments (chosen with
ork::FrameBuffer::setReadBuffer) into a ork::Buffer
(either a CPU or a GPU buffer).</li>
<li>the ork::FrameBuffer#copyPixels methods can be used to
copy pixels from one of the framebuffer attachments (chosen with
ork::FrameBuffer::setReadBuffer) into a texture.</li>
</ul>

\subsubsection sec_framebuffers1 Multiple render targets

A fragment shader can write to several framebuffer attachments 
simultaneously. Before that you must select the
attachments used for drawing with the \link
ork::FrameBuffer#setDrawBuffers setDrawBuffers\endlink
method. For example, to choose the <tt>COLOR0</tt> and <tt>
COLOR2</tt> attachments:

\code
ptr<FrameBufer> fb = ...
fb->setDrawBuffers(FrameBuffer::COLOR0 | FrameBuffer::COLOR2);
\endcode

\subsubsection sec_framebuffers2 Interactions with OpenGL

It is possible to use Ork together with the raw OpenGL API, for
instance to use new OpenGL features not yet supported in Ork.
However, since Ork maintains some internal state about the current
OpenGL state for its own use, modifying the OpenGL state outside Ork
with direct OpenGL calls can lead to inconsistencies between the
internal Ork state and the real OpenGL state. To avoid this problem
you must follow the following pattern when mixing direct OpenGL calls
with Ork:

\code
... // Ork code
FrameBuffer::resetAllStates();
... // direct OpenGL calls
FrameBuffer::resetAllStates();
... // Ork code
\endcode

\subsection sec_example An example

This section gives the code of a full example, showing how to use
textures, modules, programs, meshes and framebuffers.

\dontinclude example.cpp

\until SimpleExample()

The ork::GlutWindow class provides an object oriented view of the
basic GLUT functionalities, namely windows and user interface events
callbacks. The methods of this class can be overridden in order to
define the user interface of your application. These methods are the
\link ork::Window#redisplay redisplay\endlink,
\link ork::Window#reshape reshape\endlink,
\link ork::Window#mouseClick mouseClick\endlink,
\link ork::Window#mouseMotion mouseMotion\endlink,
\link ork::Window#keyTyped keyTyped\endlink,
\link ork::Window#specialKey specialKey\endlink, and
\link ork::Window#idle idle\endlink methods. You can then
create a window by instantiating this sub class. Note: if the initial
window size is set to (0,0) a full screen window will be created.

\until m->addVertex(vec2f(+1, +1));

The above code creates a mesh made of quads, with only one attribute
per vertex, namely a position (attribute identifier 0) made of 2
floats. It then adds four vertices to this mesh, i.e., one quad.

\until Texture::Parameters().mag(NEAREST), Buffer::Parameters(), CPUBuffer(data));

The above code creates a checkerboard texture of 4 by 4 pixels,
initialized from a CPU memory buffer, using one 8 bits channel per
pixel.

\until p->getUniformSampler("sampler")->set(tex);
\line }

The above code creates a program made of a single module, itself
made of a single fragment shader. It then
sets the value of its "sampler" uniform to the previous texture.

\until GlutWindow::redisplay(t, dt);
\line }

In the above code we override the ork::GlutWindow#redisplay
method, called at each frame, and which is responsible to redraw the
window content. We clear the default framebuffer, and then
use the previous program to draw the above mesh. The
overridden method <i>must</i> be called in order to actually update
the window content (with a <tt>glSwapBuffers</tt>).

\until };

In the above code we override the ork::GlutWindow#reshape method,
called when the window is created or resized, in order to adapt the
viewport of the framebuffer to the window size.

\until }

Finally we create an instance of our ork::Window subclass and
we call its ork::Window#start method to start the user
interface event processing loop (this method never returns). Before
that we register the static ork::Object#exit method to properly
deletes unused resources when the application stops.

\section sec_resource Resource framework

The \ref render classes do not provide any tool to load a 3D mesh, to
load the content of a texture from a PNG file (or any other image
file format), or to load the source code of a shader from a text
file. This is why in the \ref sec_example "above example" the mesh,
the texture and the shader source code were included manually in the
C++ code. Of course this way of loading content is not very
convenient. The \ref resource module provides a framework to load
this content and other data from disk. In addition this framework
provides the ability to update the resources at runtime. This is
especially useful for shaders because you can modify a shader on disk
and see instantly the effects of these changes, without needing to
restart your application.

Ork resources are managed by a ork::ResourceManager, which
uses a ork::ResourceLoader to load the actual resource
content. The ork::ResourceLoader class is abstract, but a
concrete ork::XMLResourceLoader subclass is provided. As
its name implies, it uses XML files to load resources. An XML
resource file describes the resource "meta data" (such as the
minification and magnification filters for a texture) and specifies
where the resource data (e.g., for a texture, the texture image
itself) can be found. These classes are typically used as follows:

\code
ptr<XMLResourceLoader> resLoader = new XMLResourceLoader();
resLoader->addPath("my-resources/textures");
resLoader->addPath("my-resources/shaders");
resLoader->addPath("my-resources/meshes");
\endcode

we first start by creating a ork::XMLResourceLoader, and we
configure it by adding paths where the resource files can be found. In
this example the resources are sorted by type in 3 subdirectories in
the <tt>my-resources</tt> directory, so we add these 3 paths (adding
a directory does <i>not</i> add recursively its subdirectories).

\code
ptr<ResourceManager> resManager = new ResourceManager(resLoader, 8);
\endcode

we then create a ork::ResourceManager using the previous
resource loader. The second constructor argument, 8, is the size of
the cache of unused resources. Indeed, instead of deleting
immediately an unused resource, a resource manager can cache it
temporarily, so that it does not need to reload it from disk if it is
needed again shortly after. The default cache size is 0, which means
that resources are deleted as soon as they become unused.

Once the resource loader and manager are created and configured, we
can load resources very easily with a code like this:

\code
ptr<Texture> t = resManager->loadResource("envMap").cast<Texture>();
\endcode

\note A resource is loaded only once. If you try to load an already
loaded resource, this resource instance will be returned directly.
Hence you cannot have several copies of a resource at the same time.

This code looks for a file named <tt>envMap.xml</tt> in the resource
loader paths. This file should look like this:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<textureCube name="envMap" source="myEnvMap.png"
    internalformat="RGB8" min="LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR" mag="LINEAR"/>
\endverbatim

Note that this file only contains the meta data for the texture. The
texture image is contained in the <tt>myEnvMap.png</tt> file, which
is looked for in the configured paths of the resource loader.

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\subsection sec_dummy Dummy section
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

\note The ork::XMLResourceLoader is convenient during
the development phase because you can easily change a single
resource with a text editor, and you can also do that at runtime.
But this is a drawback when you want to distribute your 
application: you may not want users to be able to see your 
resources in "clear text" (especially for shaders), and you
certainly don't want them to be able to modify them at runtime.
The ork::CompiledResourceLoader solves this problem:
it disables runtime resource updates, and loads all resources 
from a single data file (that you can encrypt if necessary), 
produced by the ork::ResourceCompiler. To use these
classes you must first run your application with the 
ork::ResourceCompiler (a subclass of 
ork::XMLResourceLoader). This will agglomerate all 
the resource data in two files, that you can then use with 
the ork::CompiledResourceLoader.

\subsubsection sec_archives Archive resource files

Alternatively, instead of using many small XML files, one per
resource, it is also possible to use <i>archive files</i> containing
several resources per file. In fact both can be used at the same
time, i.e., some resources can be loaded from individual files, while
others are loaded from one or more archive files. In order to load
resources from an archive file <tt>myArchive.xml</tt>, the
ork::XMLResourceLoader must be configured as follows:

\code
resLoader->addArchive("my-resources/myArchive.xml");
\endcode

In the archive file the individual resources must be put one after
the other inside an <tt>archive</tt> element (they are then found
based on their <tt>name</tt> attribute):

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<archive>
    ...
    <textureCube name="envMap" source="myEnvMap.png"
        internalformat="RGB8" min="LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR" mag="LINEAR"/>
    ...
</archive>
\endverbatim

\subsubsection sec_resupdate Updating resources

As said above the Ork resource manager can update already loaded
resources at runtime. For instance if you modify on disk a texture
image, a texture minification filter, a shader source code, a mesh,
etc you will see instantly in the running application the effect of
these changes: a new texture image on a 3D model, the effect of a new
texture filter, the effect of a new shader, the effect of using a
different mesh for a 3D model, etc. This is done with the
ork::ResourceManager#updateResources method.

This method checks the last modification time of the resource files
on disk to detect those that have changed since they were loaded. It
then updates these resources, and returns <tt>true</tt> if the update
was successful. Indeed the update can fail, for instance if there is
a syntax error in a GLSL shader. In this case the shader is not
updated, i.e., the old version of the shader remains in use. The
\link ork::ResourceManager#updateResources
updateResources\endlink method can be called in many different ways:
when the user presses a specific key, at regular time intervals, when
the application window gets the focus, etc.

During development it is usual to test several options in a module,
using preprocessor directives to select one option:

\verbatim
#define OPTION2

void main() {
#ifdef OPTION1
    ...
#endif
#ifdef OPTION2
    ...
#endif
...
#ifdef OPTION3
    ...
#endif
}
\endverbatim

With Ork you can change the first line at runtime to select a
different option. This change can be done manually with a text
editor, in parallel with your application.

\subsection sec_resmeshes Mesh resources

A mesh resource is loaded like this:

\code
ptr<MeshBuffers> m = resManager->loadResource("cube.mesh").cast<MeshBuffers>();
\endcode

The <tt>cube.mesh</tt> (the <tt>.mesh</tt> is important) must have
the following form (the comments are <i>not</i> part of the file):

\code
-1 1 -1 1 -1 1         // bounding box xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax
triangles              // mesh topology (points, lines, linestrip, etc)
4                      // number of attributes per vertex
0 3 float false        // attribute 1: identifier, components, format, auto normalize
1 3 float false        // attribute 2: identifier, components, format, auto normalize
2 2 float false        // attribute 3: identifier, components, format, auto normalize
3 4 ubyte true         // attribute 4: identifier, components, format, auto normalize
36                     // number of vertices
-1 -1 +1 0 0 +1 0 0 255 0 0 0  // vertex 0: position normal uv color
+1 -1 +1 0 0 +1 1 0 255 0 0 0  // vertex 1: position normal uv color
+1 +1 +1 0 0 +1 1 1 255 0 0 0  // ...
+1 +1 +1 0 0 +1 1 1 255 0 0 0
// ...
-1 -1 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 255 255 0 0 // vertex 35: position normal uv
color
0                      // number of indices (for indexed meshes)
                       // indices (empty this case)
\endcode

\subsection sec_resshaders Module resources

A module resource is loaded like this:

\code
ptr<Module> m = resManager->loadResource("myModule").cast<Module>();
\endcode

The <tt>myModule.xml</tt> file must have the following form if the
vertex, tessellation, geometry and fragment shaders are in separate
files (all the shaders are optional):

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<module name="myModule" version="330"
        vertex="myModuleVS.glsl" 
        tessControl="myModuleTCS.glsl"
        tessEvaluation="myModuleTES.glsl"
        geometry="myModuleGS.glsl"
        fragment="myModuleFS.glsl"
        options="OPTION1,DEBUG">
    <uniformSampler name="envMapSampler" texture="envMap"/>
    <uniform1f name="..." x="..."/>
    <uniform2f name="..." x="..." y="..."/>
    <uniform3f name="..." x="..." y="..." z="..."/>
    <uniform4f name="..." x="..." y="..." z="..." w="..."/>
    ...
</module>
\endverbatim

or the following form, if these shaders are grouped in a single file,
but separated with preprocessor directives:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<module name="myModule" version="330" source="myModule.glsl" options="OPTION1,DEBUG">
    <uniformSampler name="envMapSampler" texture="envMap"/>
    <uniform1f name="..." x="..."/>
    <uniform2f name="..." x="..." y="..."/>
    <uniform3f name="..." x="..." y="..." z="..."/>
    <uniform4f name="..." x="..." y="..." z="..." w="..."/>
    ...
</module>
\endverbatim

where the <tt>uniform</tt>Xxx are optional: if an uniform is declared
it will be used to set an <i>initial</i> value for this uniform in 
programs using this module.
The <tt>options</tt> attribute is also optional. It contains a comma
separated list of preprocessor directives that will be prepended to
the shader <tt>source</tt>. This can be useful to create several
shaders with a lot of code in common from a single GLSL file.

\note if loaded via the Ork resource framework, a GLSL source
file can include other source files with a <tt>\#include
&quot;</tt>...<tt>.glsl&quot;</tt>: the
ork::XMLResourceLoader will automatically detect these
directives and replace them with the content of the referenced file.

A program made of one or more modules can be loaded without declaring
any resource file:

\code
ptr<Program> p1 = resManager->loadResource("myModule;").cast<Program>();
ptr<Program> p2 = resManager->loadResource("module1;module2;").cast<Program>();
\endcode

the first line loads the program made of the single <tt>myModule</tt>
module (the ";" is important). The second line loads the program made
of the two <tt>module1</tt> and <tt>module2</tt> modules (both ";"
are important).

\subsection sec_restextures Texture resources

A texture resource is loaded like this:

\code
ptr<Texture> t = resManager->loadResource("myTexture").cast<Texture>();
\endcode

The <tt>myTexure.xml</tt> file must have the following form:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<texture3D name="myTexture" source="image.png" internalformat="..."
    min="..." mag="..." wraps="..." wrapt="..." wrapr="..." .../>
\endverbatim

where the only mandatory attributes are <tt>name</tt>, <tt>
source</tt> and <tt>internalformat</tt>, and where <tt>texture3D</tt>
can be replaced with other texture types, such as <tt>texture1D</tt>, 
<tt>texture2D</tt>, <tt>texture2DArray</tt>, <tt>textureCube</tt>, etc.
The texture image can be
in JPEG, PNG, BMP, TGA, PSD or HDR (= Radiance RGBE) format (with
some restrictions for each format).

\note A raw format is also supported, with one float per pixel
component. Such a raw file must end with five 32 bits integers, the
first one being 0xCAFEBABE, the others the width, height, depth and
components per pixel.

The 2D texture image corresponds directly to the texture content for
a 2D texture. For a 1D texture the texture image should have a single
line. For a 3D texture, the 2D texture image represents the z slices
of the 3D texture, layed out vertically (the same disposition is used
for the 2D layers of a 2D array texture). Finally, for a texture
cube, the 2D texture image represents the 6 faces of the texture
cube, layed out as shown on the right (PX means positive x axis direction, NX
negative x axis, and so on - for a texture cube array the layout is
similar, all the cube texture layers being stacked vertically):

\htmlonly
<center>
<img src="textures.png"><br/>
<div class="caption">Texture image layout for a 3D or 2D array
texture (<i>left</i>) and for a texture cube (<i>right</i>).</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html textures.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

\subsubsection sec_resrenderbuffers Render targets

Sometimes you need some textures to use them as render targets in a
framebuffer. In these cases the texture content is irrelevant. These
textures can easily be created with a ork::Texture
constructor, but it is also possible to load them via the resource
framework. The advantage is that you can share these render targets
more easily (since a resource is loaded only once, if the same render
target texture is loaded in several parts of your code, the same
texture will be used for all). This can be done as follows:

\code
resManager->loadResource("renderbuffer-64-I32F").cast<Texture>();
\endcode

The first part gives the texture size (the texture is assumed to be a
square 2D texture). The last part is the texture internal format. If
you need several distinct textures of the same format, you can use
names of the form <tt>renderbuffer-64-I32F-1</tt>, 
<tt>renderbuffer-64-I32F-2</tt>, etc.

\subsection sec_resuser User defined resources

You can define your own resources by extending the
ork::Resource class. The common pattern used in Ork is to
define a base class for the resource (so that you can instantiate and
use it without needing the resource framework), and a sub class of
this base class that also extends ork::Resource, to be able
to instantiate this resource via the Ork resource framework. The base
class has the following form:

\code
class MyClass : public Object
{
public:
    MyClass(int p1, int p2)
    {
        init(p1, p2);
    }

    ...

protected:
    MyClass();

    void init(int p1, int p2)
    {
        this->p1 = p1;
        this->p2 = p2;
    }

    virtual void swap(ptr<MyClass> c)
    {
        std::swap(p1, c->p1);
        std::swap(p2, c->p2);
    }

private:
    int p1, p2;
};
\endcode

When the class is instantiated directly the public constructor is
used. The protected constructor is used when the class is
instantiated via the Ork resource framework (this constructor must
have no parameters). The constructor code is placed in a separate
<tt>init</tt> method so that it is not duplicated between the base
class and the resource sub class (see below). The <tt>swap</tt>
method is used to replace the current instance with another one. This
is how Ork can dynamically update resources when their content has
changed on disk (there is no magic, you must implement the swap
method yourself).

The resource sub class is defined by using the
ork::ResourceTemplate class:

\code
class MyClassResource : public ResourceTemplate<0, MyClass>
{
public:
    MyClassResource(ptr<ResourceManager> manager, const string &name,
            ptr<ResourceDescriptor> desc, const TiXmlElement *e = NULL) :
        ResourceTemplate<0, MyClass>(manager, name, desc)
    {
        e = e == NULL ? desc->descriptor : e;
        int p1;
        int p2;
        checkParameters(desc, e, "name,p1,p2,");
        getIntParameter(desc, e, "p1", &p1);
        getIntParameter(desc, e, "p2", &p2);
        init(p1, p2);
    }
};

extern const char myClass[] = "myClass";

static ResourceFactory::Type<myClass, MyClassResource> MyClassType;
\endcode

this makes <tt>MyClassResource</tt> extend both <tt>MyClass</tt> and
ork::Resource (see the ork::ResourceTemplate
definition). The constructor must have this predefined signature, and
its role is to decode the XML descriptor to extract the arguments to
be passed to the <tt>init</tt> method of the super class. The last
two lines register this resource under the <tt>myClass</tt> name.
This means that when the Ork resource loader will encounter a 
<tt>&lt;myClass name="..." p1="..." p2="..."&gt;</tt> element it will create a
<tt>MyClassResource</tt> object, which will initialize itself by
decoding the XML attributes.

\subsection sec_resexample An example

We can now rewrite the \ref sec_example "above example" by using the
Ork resource framework to load the resources:

\include resource-example.cpp

The mesh, texture and module resources can now be defined in separate
files:

\verbatim
-1 1 -1 1 0 0
trianglestrip
1
0 3 float false
4
-1 -1 0
+1 -1 0
-1 +1 0
+1 +1 0
0
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The quad.mesh file</div></center>

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<texture2D name="checkerboard" source="checkerboard4x4.png" internalformat="R8"
    min="NEAREST" mag="NEAREST" wraps="CLAMP" wrapt="CLAMP"/>
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The checkerboard.xml file</div></center>

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<module name="basic" version="330" source="basicModule.glsl">
    <uniformSampler name="sampler" texture="checkerboard"/>
</module>
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The basic.xml file</div></center>

\verbatim
#ifdef _VERTEX_
layout(location=0) in vec4 vertex;
out vec2 uv;
void main() {
    gl_Position = vertex;
    uv = vertex.xy * 0.5 + vec2(0.5);
}
#endif
#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
uniform sampler2D sampler;
in vec2 uv;
layout(location=0) out vec4 color;
void main() {
    color = texture(sampler, uv);
}
#endif
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The basicModule.glsl file</div></center>

\section sec_scene Scene graph

Most of the interesting 3D scenes contain more than a single quad. In
these cases you have to manage for each object one or more mesh (for
instance if you want to use different meshes depending on the level
of details), one or more textures, one or more modules, etc. You also
have to manage reference frames to place the objects in a global
scene, ignore objects that are not in the view frustum, etc.

Then you have several options to draw your scene:
<ul>
<li>you can render each object in one pass, using a module that
computes the contribution of each light in a loop.</li>

<li>you can render each object in several passes, for instance to
draw at each pass the contribution of one light.</li>

<li>you can render all the objects in a G-buffer containing
positions, normals and material identifiers, and perform the shading
of all objects at once by rendering full screen quads (this is called
deferred shading).</li>

<li>in all cases you may need a first pass (or more) to draw your
scene into shadow maps. Here you can choose to use one shadow map per
light (this is needed if you want to use the first method above), or
to reuse the same shadow map for all lights (then you must use the
second method: draw the shadow map for the first light, draw the
objects with lighting from this light, then replace the shadow map
content with the shadow map for the second light, draw the objects
with lighting from the second light, etc).</li>

<li>in all cases you may also need postprocessing passes to perform
tone mapping or depth of field effects. You may also want to overlay
some images or text on top of the 3D scene.</li>
</ul>

In order to leave all these options open, Ork provides a "toy"
scene graph which is minimal but fully extensible (at the price
of efficicency, i.e., this scene graph cannot be used with scenes
made of hundreds or thousands of nodes).
In fact an Ork scene graph is a <i>tree</i> of generic scene nodes
ork::SceneNode, where each node can be seen as an object
with a state (fields) and a behavior (methods). The state is made of
a reference frame (relatively to the parent node), some meshes,
modules and uniforms (that can reference textures), and any other
user defined values. The behavior is made of methods, completely
defined by the user by combining basic tasks (draw a mesh, set a
projection matrix, etc) with control structures (sequences, loops,
etc). Scene nodes, methods and tasks are explained below.

\subsection sec_scenenode Nodes

A scene node is an instance of the ork::SceneNode class.
The <b>state</b> associated with a scene node is made of:
<ul>
<li>a reference frame, relatively to the parent node. This reference
frame can be retrieved with
ork::SceneNode#getLocalToParent: this is the
transformation matrix to transform local coordinates in the local
reference frame to coordinates in the parent reference frame. You can
also transform local coordinates to world coordinates (i.e. to
coordinates in the reference frame of the root node in the scene
graph) with ork::SceneNode#getLocalToWorld (or do the
reverse with ork::SceneNode#getWorldToLocal). Finally you
can transform points from the local reference frame to the camera
frame or to the screen frame with
ork::SceneNode#getLocalToCamera and
ork::SceneNode#getLocalToScreen (the camera frame is the
reference frame of the node defined as the "camera" in the scene
manager - see below).</li>

<li>a bounding box, defined in the local reference frame of the node.
This bounding box can be used to perform view frustum culling (see
\ref sec_methods).</li>

<li>a set of flags, that you can use as you want (there are no
predefined flags, with predefined semantics). For instance you can
flag some nodes as "object", others as "light", others as
"transparent", others as "overlay", etc. Flags can be referenced in
loops, so that you can iterate over objects flagged as "light", for
instance (see \ref sec_methods).</li>

<li>a set of values. These values can store node specific values,
such as a specific texture, a specific ambient or diffuse color,
etc.</li>

<li>a set of modules. For instance you can have one module to draw
the object in the final framebuffer, another to draw the object in a
shadow map etc.</li>

<li>a set of meshes. For instance you can have one mesh per level of
details.</li>

<li>a set of arbitrary ork::Object. Here you can store any
other value you need in (the methods of) your scene node.</li>
</ul>

The <b>behavior</b> associated with a node is defined as a set of
ork::Method. They are explained below (see \ref
sec_methods). Finally each scene node has a list of child nodes, that
you can get and modify with ork::SceneNode#getChild,
ork::SceneNode#addChild and
ork::SceneNode#removeChild.

Since an Ork scene node is fully generic, there are no specific scene
node classes for lights, objects, cameras, etc. In fact all the nodes
in a scene graph are instances of the ork::SceneNode
class, but their state and behavior can be completely different
because they are fully specified by the user.

\subsubsection sec_resnodes Scene node resources

Scene nodes can be loaded with the Ork resource framework. A scene
node resource must have the following form:

\verbatim
<node name="cubeNode" flags="object,castshadow">
    <translate x="0" y="0" z="10"/>
    <rotatex angle="5"/>
    <rotatey angle="10"/>
    <rotatez angle="15"/>
    <bounds xmin="-1" xmax="1" ymin="-1" ymax="1" zmin="-1" zmax="1"/>
    <uniform3f id="ambient" name="ambientColor" x="0" y="0.1" z="0.2"/>
    <module id="material" value="plastic"/>
    <mesh id="geometry" value="cube.mesh"/>
    <field id="..." value="..."/>
    <method id="draw" value="objectMethod"/>
    <method id="shadow" value="shadowMethod"/>
</node>
\endverbatim

The elements inside the <tt>node</tt> element are all optional and
can be in any order. There can be any number of <tt>translate</tt>,
<tt>rotatex</tt>, <tt>rotatey</tt> and <tt>rotatez</tt> elements, to
define the transformation from the local node to the parent node (the
first transformation is applied last). The <tt>bounds</tt> element
defines the bounding box, in local coordinates. If there is a mesh
(as in this example), this element is not necessary: the bounding box
is automatically set to the bounding box of the mesh. You can also
declare some uniforms (<tt>uniform1f</tt>, <tt>uniform2f</tt>, <tt>
uniform3f</tt>, <tt>uniform4f</tt>, <tt>uniformMatrix3f</tt>, <tt>
uniformMatrix4f</tt> or <tt>uniformSampler</tt>), some modules and
some meshes with nested <tt>module</tt> and <tt>mesh</tt> elements.
You can also declare arbitrary fields and methods with the <tt>
field</tt> and <tt>method</tt> elements (<tt>id</tt> is the field or
method name, <tt>value</tt> its value, which must be the name of a
resource). Finally you can associate some flags to the scene node in
the <tt>flags</tt> attribute, which is a comma separated list of
flags.

It is also possible to load a full scene graph with the Ork resource
framework. Indeed you can also specify in a scene node resource the
child nodes of this node. You can specify these child nodes by
reference or by value:

\verbatim
<node name="myScene">
    <node flags="camera">
        <module id="material" value="cameraModule"/>
        <method id="draw" value="cameraMethod"/>
    </node>
    <node name="myCube" value="cubeNode"/>
    <node flags="overlay">
        <method id="draw" value="logMethod"/>
    </node>
</node>
\endverbatim

here the <tt>camera</tt> and <tt>overlay</tt> nodes are specified by
value, i.e. directly inside the <tt>myScene</tt> node (nodes can be
nested inside nodes without limit), but the <tt>myCube</tt> node is
specified by reference to the above <tt>cubeNode</tt> node. The
advantage of specifying nodes by reference is that you can reuse them
more easily. You can also reference them as individual resources,
while nested nodes cannot be loaded separately (you have to load to
whole root node to load them).

\subsubsection sec_scenemanager Scene manager

The ork::SceneManager manages a scene graph:
<ul>
<li>it gives the root node of the scene graph, with
ork::SceneManager#getRoot. You can change this node with
ork::SceneManager#setRoot.</li>

<li>it defines which node of the scene graph is the "camera", with
ork::SceneManager#getCameraNode. This
node must have a "draw" method, whose name is specified with
ork::SceneManager#setCameraMethod. This method defines
how the full scene must be rendered (in particular it must define all
the shadowing, lighting, rendering, and postprocessing passes).</li>

<li>it has an associated ork::ResourceManager, that can be
used to load and update the scene graph resources at runtime.</li>

<li>finally the scene manager provides an <tt>update</tt> and a <tt>
draw</tt> method. The <tt>update</tt> method updates the
transformation matrices from the nodes to the world, camera and
screen frames, after you changed the transformation matrices of nodes
with ork::SceneNode#setLocalToParent. The <tt>draw</tt>
method simply executes the "draw" method of the camera node. Hence
its behavior is completely defined by the user, which can use a
forward rendering strategy, a deferred rendering approach, or any
other strategy.</li>
</ul>

\subsection sec_methods Methods

A ork::Method defines a behavior of a scene node. It can
be a basic task or a combination of basic tasks using sequences,
loops or method calls. The basic tasks are presented in the next
section. We present here the control structures to combine them,
using examples showing how methods can be organized in a scene graph
(like scene nodes, methods can be loaded from XML files with the Ork
resource framework. The examples below show how these XML files must
be defined).

As said above a scene is drawn by executing a specific method on the
scene node that is defined as the "camera" node, which must perform
all the passes needed to render the scene. This method is often the
most complex method in a scene. We show here an example with four
passes: a pass to update animated objects, a pass to draw shadow
maps, a pass to draw the objects, and a pass to draw overlays (e.g. a
framerate indicator). This method is organized as a sequence of 4
loops: there is one loop per pass, and the sequence ensures that the
passes are executed in order:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sequence>
    <foreach var="o" flag="dynamic" parallel="true">
        <callMethod name="$o.update"/>
    </foreach>
    <foreach var="l" flag="light">
        <callMethod name="$l.draw"/>
    </foreach>
    <foreach var="o" flag="object" culling="true">
        <callMethod name="$o.draw"/>
    </foreach>
    <foreach var="o" flag="overlay">
        <callMethod name="$o.draw"/>
    </foreach>
</sequence>
\endverbatim

The <tt>sequence</tt> element contains any number of tasks: these
tasks can be basic tasks, sequence tasks, loop tasks, etc. They are
executed one after the other.

The <tt>loop</tt> task executes the tasks specified as nested
elements on an <i>unordered</i> set of scene nodes (again these
nested tasks can be arbitrary: basic tasks, sequence tasks, loop
tasks, etc). The nested tasks are executed in sequence on each scene
node. The scene nodes are specified via the <tt>flag</tt> attribute:
indeed the loop tasks are executed, by default, on all the nodes of
the scene graph that have the specified flag. This default behavior
can be changed with the <tt>culling</tt> and <tt>parallel</tt>
options:
<ul>
<li>if the <tt>culling</tt> option is set (as in the third loop
above) the loop is applied to the scene nodes that have the specified
flag <i>and</i> that are in the view frustum (more precisely whose
bounding box intersects the view frustum).</li>

<li>if the <tt>parallel</tt> option is set (as in the first loop
above) the loop is applied to the scene nodes specified by this loop
in parallel (by default the loop is applied in sequence, one scene
node after the other). This is possible only for CPU tasks, as the
OpenGL context does not support multithreading.</li>
</ul>
The <tt>var</tt> attribute is the loop variable. It can be used to
reference the scene node to which the loop is currently being applied
to. For instance if the loop variable is <tt>var="l"</tt> then in the
nested tasks <tt>$l</tt> refers to the scene node to which the loop
is currently being applied to (nested loops must use different loop
variable names).

The <tt>callMethod</tt> task executes another method on some scene
node. It takes a single <tt>name</tt> argument that specifies the
target scene node and the target method, separated by a dot. The
target node can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li><tt>this</tt>: in this case the target method is called on the
scene node on which the current method is executed.</li>

<li><tt>$</tt><i>var</i>: in this case the target node is a scene
node to which a loop is currently being applied to. Of course this
kind of target can only be used inside a loop.</li>

<li><i>flag</i>: in all other cases the target name is interpreted as
a flag name, and the target scene node is defined as the node having
this flag (there must be only one such node).</li>
</ul>

We can now understand the above example as follows: call the <tt>
update</tt> method, in parallel, on all nodes with the <tt>
dynamic</tt> flag, then call the <tt>draw</tt> method on all nodes
with the <tt>light</tt> flag, then call the <tt>draw</tt> method on
all nodes with the <tt>object</tt> flag that are visible, and finally
call the <tt>draw</tt> method on all nodes with the <tt>overlay</tt>
flag.

Note that this example use method calls to perform the actual work of
drawing shadows maps, drawing objects or drawing overlays. It would
have been possible to include the actual tasks to do this directly in
the loops, but this would have been much less generic. Indeed, with
the above organization, you can use polymorphism, as in object
oriented languages, to implement the same method in different ways in
different scene nodes. For instance the <tt>draw</tt> method of a
light could either draw a shadow map or do nothing, depending on
whether this light should cast shadows or not.

\subsection sec_tasks Tasks

This section presents the basic tasks that can be used to implement
scene node methods. They are presented via their XML representation,
but you can also use them programmatically. There are tasks to select
a framebuffer and its attachments, to set its associated pipeline
state, to select a program, to set transformation matrices from local
to world, camera or screen space, to draw a mesh, and to draw some
information messages. This section also shows how you can define your
own tasks if needed.

\subsubsection sec_settarget setTarget task

The ork::SetTargetTask task selects a framebuffer and its
attachments. It can be used to select the default framebuffer, or an
offscreen framebuffer with some specific attachments. To select the
default framebuffer, use:

\verbatim
<setTarget/>
\endverbatim

To select an offscreen framebuffer with some attachments, use:

\verbatim
<setTarget>
    <buffer name="COLOR0" texture="..."/>
    <buffer name="COLOR2" texture="..." level="1" layer="3"/>
    ...
</setTarget>
\endverbatim

The <tt>name</tt> attribute specifies the attachment point (it can be
<tt>COLOR</tt><i>i</i> or <tt>DEPTH</tt>). The <tt>texture</tt>
attribute designates a texture, and can have the following forms:
<ul>
<li><i>name</i>: in this case the render target is the texture
resource whose name is <i>name</i>.</li>

<li><tt>this.</tt><i>name</i>, <tt>$</tt>v<tt>.</tt><i>name</i>, <i>
flag</i><tt>.</tt><i>name</i>: in this case the render target is the
texture bound to the uniform sampler <i>name</i> of the target scene
node <tt>this</tt>, <tt>$</tt>v or <i>flag</i> (see \ref
sec_methods).</li>

<li><tt>this.</tt><i>module</i><tt>:</tt><i>name</i>, <tt>$</tt>
v<tt>.</tt><i>module</i><tt>:</tt><i>name</i>, <i>flag</i><tt>.</tt>
<i>module</i><tt>:</tt><i>name</i>: in this case the render target is
the texture bound to the uniform sampler <i>name</i> of the module
<i>module</i> of the target scene node <tt>this</tt>, <tt>$</tt>v or
<i>flag</i> (see \ref sec_methods).</li>
</ul>

The <tt>level</tt> and <tt>layer</tt> attributes are optional. They
specify the mipmap level of the texture you want to attach (0 by
default), and the layer (resp. z slice, resp. face number) of the
texture you want to attach, for a 2D array texture (resp. 3D texture,
resp. 2D cube texture).

\subsubsection sec_setstate setState task

The ork::SetStateTask task sets the pipeline state of the
currently selected framebuffer (read and draw buffers,
stencil, and depth tests, clearing, blending, culling and writing
states, etc). It has the following form (all attributes and nested
elements are optional):

\verbatim
<setState readBuffer="COLOR0" drawBuffer="COLOR1"
        clearColor="true" clearStencil="false" clearDepth="true">
    <clear r="0" g="0" b="0" a="0" stencil="0" depth="1"/>
    <polygon front="FILL" back="CULL"/>
    ... TODO ...
</setState>
\endverbatim

\subsubsection sec_setprogram setProgram task

The ork::SetProgramTask task selects a program made of
one or more modules. It has the following form:

\verbatim
<setProgram setUniforms="true">
    <module name="atmosphereModule"/>
    <module name="camera.material"/>
    <module name="light.material"/>
    <module name="this.material"/>
    ...
</setProgram>
\endverbatim

Each module is specified with a <tt>module</tt> element. The module
name can have the following forms:
<ul>
<li><i>name</i>: in this case the module is the module resource whose
name is <i>name</i>.</li>

<li><tt>this.</tt><i>name</i>, <tt>$</tt>v<tt>.</tt><i>name</i>, <i>
flag</i><tt>.</tt><i>name</i>: in this case the module is the module
<i>name</i> of the target scene node <tt>this</tt>, <tt>$</tt>v or
<i>flag</i> (see \ref sec_methods).</li>
</ul>

In the above example the program is made of a module that defines
functions for atmospheric effects (designed by its resource name), a
module that defines functions to project 3D points to screen space
(attached to the "camera" scene node under the "material" name), a
module that defines functions to illuminate surfaces from a light
(attached to the "light" scene node under the "material" name) and a
module that combines all these functions with a surface material
(attached to the scene node on which the method that executes this
task has been called).

The <tt>setUniforms</tt> attribute is optional. If present, the
uniforms defined in the scene node from which this task is 
executed will be set in the program. This option can be useful
to set object specific values in a program before drawing it
on screen (like a color, a texture, etc).

\subsubsection sec_settransforms setTransforms task

The ork::SetTransformsTask task can set some
transformation matrices from local to world, camera or screen space
in a program. It has the following form (all attributes are
optional):

\verbatim
<setTransforms localToWorld="..." localToScreen="..."
    screen="..." screenToCamera="..." cameraToWorld="..."
    module="..." worldToScreen="..." worldPos="..." worldDir="..."/>
\endverbatim

<ul>
<li>the <tt>localToWorld</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>
mat4</tt> uniform. This uniform is set to the transformation matrix
from the local frame to the world frame. The local frame is the
reference frame of the scene node on which the method that executes
this task has been called. The uniform is set in the currently
selected program.</li>

<li>the <tt>localToScreen</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>
mat4</tt> uniform. This uniform is set to the transformation matrix
from the local frame to the screen frame. The local frame is the
reference frame of the scene node on which the method that executes
this task has been called. The screen frame is the reference frame of
the screen, unless the <tt>screen</tt> attribute is set: in this case
it is the reference frame of the <tt>screen</tt> scene node. The
uniform is set in the currently selected program.</li>

<li>the <tt>screenToCamera</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>
mat4</tt> uniform. This uniform is set to the transformation matrix
from the screen frame to the camera frame. The uniform is set in the
currently selected program.</li>

<li>the <tt>cameraToWorld</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>
mat4</tt> uniform. This uniform is set to the transformation matrix
from the camera frame to the world frame. The uniform is set in the
currently selected program.</li>

<li>the <tt>worldToScreen</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>
mat4</tt> uniform of the <tt>module</tt> module (the <tt>module</tt>
attribute must be set if <tt>worldToScreen</tt> is set). This uniform
is set to the transformation matrix from the world frame to the screen
frame. The screen frame is the reference frame of the screen, unless
the <tt>screen</tt> attribute is set: in this case it is the
reference frame of the <tt>screen</tt> scene node.</li>

<li>the <tt>worldPos</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>vec3</tt>
uniform of the <tt>module</tt> module (the <tt>module</tt> attribute
must be set if <tt>worldPos</tt> is set). This uniform is set to the
world coordinates of the origin of the local reference frame. The
local frame is the reference frame of the scene node on which the
method that executes this task has been called.</li>

<li>the <tt>worldDir</tt> attribute is the name of a <tt>vec3</tt>
uniform of the <tt>module</tt> module (the <tt>module</tt> attribute
must be set if <tt>worldPos</tt> is set). This uniform is set to the
world coordinates of the unit z vector of the local reference frame.
The local frame is the reference frame of the scene node on which the
method that executes this task has been called.</li>
</ul>

Both <tt>screen</tt> and <tt>module</tt> can be of the form <i>
name</i>, <tt>this.</tt><i>name</i>, <tt>$</tt>v<tt>.</tt><i>name</i>
or <i>flag</i><tt>.</tt><i>name</i> (see \ref sec_methods).

\subsubsection sec_drawmesh drawMesh task

The ork::DrawMeshTask task draws a mesh using the
currently selected framebuffer and program. It has the following
form:

\verbatim
<drawMesh name="..." count="..."/>
\endverbatim

The mesh name can have the following forms:
<ul>
<li><i>name</i>: in this case the mesh is the mesh resource whose
name is <i>name</i><tt>.mesh</tt>.</li>

<li><tt>this.</tt><i>name</i>, <tt>$</tt>v<tt>.</tt><i>name</i>, <i>
flag</i><tt>.</tt><i>name</i>: in this case the mesh is the mesh <i>
name</i> of the target scene node <tt>this</tt>, <tt>$</tt>v or <i>
flag</i> (see \ref sec_methods).</li>
</ul>

The <tt>count</tt> attribute is optional (its default value is 1).
This integer specifies the number of time the mesh must be drawn
(using geometric instancing).

\subsubsection sec_showinfo showInfo task

The ork::ShowInfoTask task displays the framerate and
other text information in the current framebuffer. It has the
following form (all the attributes are optional: their default values
are the one of the example):

\verbatim
<showInfo x="4" y="-4" maxLines="8"
    fontSize="16" fontAspect="0.59375" fontProgram="text;" font="defaultFont"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> attributes specify where the
information must be displayed, in pixels from the bottom left corner
of the screen (or, if <tt>y</tt> is negative, from the top left
corner). The <tt>maxLines</tt> attribute specifies the maximum number
of lines of text that can be displayed. The <tt>fontSize</tt>
attribute specifies the vertical size of characters, in pixels. The
<tt>fontAspect</tt> attribute specifies the width / height ratio of
each character (a fixed width is assumed for each character). Finally
the <tt>fontProgram</tt> attribute must be the name of a program resource.
This program is responsible to draw characters. It must take as input
triangles whose vertices have xy coordinates in screen
space, and uv coordinates (in the <tt>zw</tt> coordinates)
in a font texture.

By default the showInfo task displays only the framerate. You can
display additional text by using the
ork::ShowInfoTask#setInfo method in your code.

\subsubsection sec_showlog showLog task

The ork::ShowLogTask task is similar to the showInfo
task, but displays the message logs on screen (see \ref sec_logger).
By default this task is disabled, i.e. it displays nothing, until a
warning or error log occurs. It then stays enabled as long as the
ork::ShowLogTask#enabled flag is not set to <tt>
false</tt> by the user. If a new warning or error log occurs the task
will again enable itself automatically. And so on. This can be useful
to be notified of warnings or errors, in particular after an update
of resources on disk (see \ref sec_resupdate). The showLog task has
the same format as the \ref sec_showinfo :

\verbatim
<showLog x="4" y="-4" maxLines="8"
    fontSize="16" fontAspect="0.59375" fontProgram="text;" font="defaultFont"/>
\endverbatim

\subsubsection sec_usertask User defined tasks

You can define your own tasks and your own task resources by
extending the ork::AbstractTask class. Using the basic
pattern to define resources (see \ref sec_resuser), a new task can be
defined as follows:

\code
class MyTask : public AbstractTask
{
public:
    MyTask(...) { init(...); }

    virtual ptr<Task> getTask(ptr<Object> context)
    {
        return new Impl(...);
    }

protected:
    MyTask() { }

    void init(...) { ... }

    void swap(ptr<MyTask> t) { ... }

private:
    ...

    class Impl : public Task
    {
    public:
        ...

        Impl(...) { ... }

        virtual bool run()
        {
            // put your task implementation here
        }
    };
};
\endcode

with the corresponding resource class:

\code
class MyTaskResource : public ResourceTemplate<0, MyTask>
{
public:
    MyTaskResource(ptr<ResourceManager> manager, const string &name,
            ptr<ResourceDescriptor> desc, const TiXmlElement *e = NULL) :
        ResourceTemplate<0, MyClass>(manager, name, desc)
    {
        ...
        init(...);
    }
};
extern const char myTask[] = "myTask";
static ResourceFactory::Type<myTask, MyTaskResource> MyTaskType;
\endcode

\subsection sec_sceneexample An example

We can now rewrite the \ref sec_example "above example" (see also
\ref sec_resexample) by using an Ork scene graph, together with the
Ork resource framework:

\include scenegraph-example.cpp

using the following new resource files:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<node name="scene">
    <node flag="camera">
        <method id="draw" value="basicCamera"/>
    </node>

    <node flag="object">
        <mesh id="geometry" value="quad.mesh"/>
        <module id="material" value="basic"/>
    </node>
</node>
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The scene.xml file</div></center>

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<foreach var="o" flag="object">
    <setProgram>
        <module name="$o.material"/>
    </setProgram>
    <drawMesh name="$o.geometry"/>
</foreach>
\endverbatim
<center><div class="caption">The basicCamera.xml file</div></center>

\section sec_task Task graph

As explained in the previous section, the methods of a scene node are
made of basic tasks organized with sequences and loops. Thanks to
parallel loops tasks can be executed in parallel, using the multiple
cores of modern CPUs. This is especially useful in a context where
the scene data must be streamed to the GPU or produced on the fly on
GPU (because this data is too large to fit in GPU memory). Indeed, in
this case, several threads can be used to produce the scene data, in
parallel with the main thread that displays this data on screen. The
scene data can even be produced ahead of time in these threads, using
predictions of the next viewpoints for the future frames.

However this parallel execution of tasks can not be done without a
<i>scheduling framework</i>: there must be a definition of tasks, and
the dependencies between tasks must be explicit, so that a task is
not started before the tasks that produce the data it needs are all
executed. This is why Ork provides such a framework, in the
\ref taskgraph module. This framework provides the following
features:
<ul>
<li>basic tasks can be CPU or GPU tasks. CPU tasks can be executed in
parallel, while GPU tasks can only be executed in sequence (the
OpenGL model supports only sequential execution).</li>

<li>the GPU tasks have a "context" that represents an OpenGL state.
GPU tasks having the same context are automatically grouped together
(when the dependencies between them allow this), in order to minimize
the number of OpenGL state change (e.g., changing of current
framebuffer, program, etc.).</li>

<li>all tasks have a deadline, a time before which they must be
executed. Hence it is possible to schedule tasks that must be
executed for the current frame, as well as tasks whose result is not
needed before a few frames. This can be used to <i>prefetch</i> some
data from disk to CPU, or from CPU to GPU, in order to better balance
the work load between frames.</li>

<li>the execution time of tasks can be monitored to predict the
execution time of future tasks of the same type, based on the
algorithmic "complexity" of tasks (provided by the user). This is
useful if a fixed framerate must be ensured: then a prefetch task
whose predicted execution time is too large to be executed before the
deadline for the current frame is not be executed.</li>

<li>the dependencies between tasks, i.e., the fact that some task
must be executed before another (typically because it needs the
result produced by the other task) are defined in <i>task graphs</i>.
It is also possible to define, recursively, dependencies between task
graphs (which are a special type of task), by adding them into larger
graphs. Note that a task or task graph can be added in several task
graphs at the same time.</li>

<li>a task instance is executed only once: if the user schedules a
task for execution, and if this task has already been executed, it
will not be executed again. Hence if you want to execute a task at
each frame, for example, you must create new instances of this task
at each frame, and schedule each instance only once. The only
exception to this rule is when you explicitly <i>reschedule</i> a
task. In this case the task will be executed in any case, even if it
has already been executed. Moreover, all the tasks that depend on
this rescheduled task will also be reexecuted, and so on recursively.
This feature is useful when you change the input data of a task: by
rescheduling this task its result will be recomputed to take the new
input into account. In fact all the data that depends directly or
indirectly from this input, via other tasks, will be recomputed as
well.</li>
</ul>

\subsection sec_basictask Basic tasks

Basic tasks are represented with the ork::Task class. The
ork::Task#isGpuTask method indicates wheter this task is a
GPU task or not. If it is a GPU task, its context is given by
ork::Task#getContext. It is set and unset with the
ork::Task#begin and ork::Task#end methods. The
task itself is defined by the ork::Task#run method. The
task deadline is managed with ork::Task#getDeadline and
ork::Task#setDeadline.

\subsection sec_taskgraph Task graphs

Task graphs are represented with the ork::TaskGraph class.
In order to create a task graph you must first add some tasks in the
graph, with ork::TaskGraph#addTask method. You can then
define the dependencies between them with
ork::TaskGraph#addDependency.

The ork::Scheduler class is an abstract class that defines
how tasks can be scheduled for execution. The
ork::Scheduler#run method is used to schedule a task or
task graph for immediate execution. It does not return until all the
tasks with an immediate deadline have been executed (the task graph
can contain tasks whose deadline is not immediate). The
ork::Scheduler#schedule method is used to schedule tasks
whose deadline is not immediate. It puts these tasks in a pool of
tasks to be executed, and returns immediately. This method must not
be called if the scheduler does not support prefetch (this can be
determined with ork::Scheduler#supportsPrefetch). Finally
the ork::Scheduler#reschedule method is used to reexecute
some tasks. It marks these tasks and all the tasks that depend on
them as "not executed", puts them in the pool of tasks to be
executed, and returns immediately.

The ork::MultithreadScheduler is a concrete implementation
of ork::Scheduler. Its constructor takes a framerate and a
number of threads in parameter. If the framerate is 0 then no
framerate is imposed. Otherwise the scheduler tries to impose this
target framerate (if necessary it waits between frame to avoid
increasing the framerate above the target). The number of threads
indicates how many additional threads the scheduler can use, in
addition to the main threads. A number of 0 means that all tasks will
be executed in sequence with a single thread. Such a scheduler can be
loaded with the resource framework, using the following format:

\verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<multithreadScheduler name="myScheduler" nthreads="3" fps="0"/>
\endverbatim

\note The ork::AbstractTask class is not a
ork::Task, but a ork::TaskFactory, i.e.
something that creates tasks. This means that all the "tasks"
presented in the previous section are in fact task factories. This is
because, as said above, a task can not be reexecuted at each frame
unless a new instance is created each time.

\subsubsection sec_taskexample An example

Here is an example of a task graph, with several nested graphs. The
basic tasks are represented with squares, the task graphs with
rectangles, and the tasks dependencies with arrows:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="ork-taskgraph.svg" width="80%" type="image/svg+xml"/>
<br/>
<div class="caption">A task graph example. Note that tasks and graphs
can be shared between graphs (e.g., T3).</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html ork-taskgraph.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This task graph is equivalent with the following "flattened" graph,
without any nested graph:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="ork-flattenedgraph.svg" width="80%"
type="image/svg+xml"/><br/>
<div class="caption">The flattened graph corresponding to the above
nested graphs.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html ork-flattenedgraph.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

Note that the shared tasks that appeared in several graphs now appear
only once. Note also that the dependency between the task graph T9
and the task T0 has been replaced with several dependencies, between
all the sub tasks without dependencies of T9, and T0. If the T0 task
is rescheduled, then all tasks are reexecuted. If the T6 task is
rescheduled, then only T6, T7 and T9 tasks are reexecuted.

\section sec_ui User interface

Ork also gives the ability to easily create Windows and handle 
events such as those provided by glut.

\subsection sec_eventhandlers Event Handlers

The ork::EventHandler class contains functions that should 
be called when an event occurs. Some of them return a 
boolean indicating if the event has been handled by this handler.
The EventHandler abstraction provides independence from the 
interface system that you want to use (i.e. glut, MS Windows native 
windows, ...).

The event functions are the following:
<ul>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#redisplay() redisplay\endlink: 
Called at each new frame.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#reshape() reshape\endlink: 
Called when the window is resized.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#idle() idle\endlink: 
Called when nothing happened.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#mouseClick() mouseClick\endlink: 
Called when the user clicks; This method uses the mouse position, 
the button that was used, if it was pressed or released, and if any
modifier was used (ALT, CTRL, ..). </li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#mouseMotion() mouseMotion\endlink: 
Called when the mouse moves.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#mouseWheel() mouseWheel\endlink: 
Called when the mouse wheel was used. </li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#mousePassiveMotion() mousePassiveMotion\endlink: 
Called when the mouse moves with no other events.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#keyTyped() keyTyped\endlink: 
Called when a key was typed.</li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#keyReleased() keyReleased\endlink: 
Called when a key was released. </li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#specialKey() specialKey\endlink: 
Called when certain keys are typed (ESC, PAGE_UP, HOME etc...). </li>
<li> \link ork::EventHandler#specialKeyReleased() specialKeyReleased\endlink: 
Called when certain keys are released. </li>
</ul>

ork::EventHandler also provides enums describing the events (Mouse 
button \link ork::EventHandler#button name\endlink and 
\link ork::EventHandler#state state\endlink, key 
\link ork::EventHandler#modifier modifiers\endlink, special key 
\link ork::EventHandler#key names\endlink, mouse 
\link ork::EventHandler#wheel() wheel state\endlink).

\subsection sec_windows Windows

Windows are EventHandler themselves, so once initialized, they behave 
just like any other EventHandler. They can be moved, resized, navigated 
through,... via this system.

ork::Window is the abstract super class for windows. A concrete
subclass ork::GlutWindow is provided. This implementation is based on
GLUT.
