REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ork requires the latest driver for your graphics card, providing support for
OpenGL 3.3. Ork can also benefit from some OpenGL 4.1 features (like the
glProgramUniform* entry points), but it does not require a full support of
OpenGL 4.0 or 4.1 to be used (unless you want to use the new features provided
by OpenGL 4, like tesselation).

Ork also requires the following external libraries:
- glew-1.5.6
- pthreads-2.8.0 (only the task graph and scene graph frameworks)
- glut or freeglut (only for the GlutWindow class)

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ork comes with two project files, one for Code::Blocks (either on Windows or
Linux), the other for Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. Each project has four targets
to build:
- the Ork library in debug mode
- the Ork library in release mode
- unit tests for Ork
- examples using Ork

For the Code::Blocks project you need to define the following global compiler
variables:
- glut (base) : either glut32 or freeglut 
- glut (cflags) : either USE_GLUT or USE_FREEGLUT
- glew : the path to the glew DLL, e.g. C:\Progra~1\glew\glew32.dll

The USE_SHARED_PTR preprocessor flag can be set to use std::tr1::shared_ptr
(needs a compiler providing support for this). Otherwise smart pointers use
an Ork specific implementation (potentially more efficient since based on
intrusive counters).


UNIT TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit tests are launched with the following command line:

ork-tests (ALL | FORK | testName) [GL4]

ALL runs all the tests in a single process, FORK runs each test in a separate
process, and 'testName' runs only the test named 'testName'. GL4 is optional.
If present, it means that a GL4 context should be used to run the tests (this
only works with freeglut - in other cases the default context is used).

EXAMPLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nine examples are provided with Ork. They are run with the following
command lines:

- ork-examples minimal

- ork-examples render examples
- ork-examples resource examples
- ork-examples scenegraph examples
- ork-examples scenegraphresource exampleScene

- ork-examples scenegraphresource postprocessScene
- ork-examples scenegraphresource skyboxScene
- ork-examples scenegraphresource cubesScene

- ork-examples tessellation

The minimal example displays a checkerboard pattern. The next four examples
are four different implementations of the same "application", showing a cube
floating over a plane. The first implementation uses the core API only, the
second one uses this API together with the resource framework, the third
implementation uses the scene graph framework, and the fourth uses the scene
graph framework via the resource framework. This fourth implementation can in
fact load any scene graph, as shown by the next three examples:
postprocessScene shows how the generic scene graph can be use to define
various rendering strategies, skyboxScene illustrates how cubemap textures
must be defined in 2D textures, and cubesScene shows how uniforms defined in
scene nodes can be used in GLSL programs. The last example illustrates how
tessellation shaders can be used (it only works with an OpenGL 4 graphics
card).

KNOWN BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some tests fail with ATI cards (e.g. HD 2400 or HD 5400), in particular all
the tests related to uniform blocks. As a consequence, many examples fail too.
These bugs do not appear with NVIDIA cards (e.g. GTX 470 or GTX 260M), so we 
suspect driver bugs.
